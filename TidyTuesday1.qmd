Using a World Bank data set, I visualized the inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, of 52 countries across the last few decades. Historically, South Africa has experienced the highest levels of inequality, followed by Brazil, although inequality in both countries has decreased over time. Countries with low levels of inequality included Iceland, Finland, and Switzerland. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: "ginicoefficient-over-time"
#| fig-alt: "The line graph shows the Gini Coefficient of 52 countries over time. South Africa has experienced the highest levels of inequality, followed by Brazil, although inequality in both countries has decreased over time. Countries with low levels of inequality included Iceland, Finland, and Switzerland."
#| fig-cap: "The country with the highest inequality by far was South Africa. Those with low inequality included Iceland, Finland, and Switzerland."
