About my analysis:

Using a data set from the World Bank of the gini coefficients of 52 countries over the last few decades, I hoped to visualize inequality across these countries over time. South Africa has historically been by far the most unequal country, as measured by the gini coefficient.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-08-05')
income_inequality_processed <- tuesdata$income_inequality_processed
income_inequality_raw <- tuesdata$income_inequality_raw

ggplot(data=income_inequality_processed, aes(x=Year, y=gini_mi_eq, color=Entity)) + geom_line() + labs(title="Inequality in countries across time", x="Year", y="Gini Index", color="Country")
```

```
